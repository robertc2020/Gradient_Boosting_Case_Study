# Gradient_Boosting_Case_Study

In this exercise you will gain a full understanding of how gradient boosting works to improve predictions based on information from the residuals. First, you'll apply this method to a regression problem then to a classification problem using the Titanic dataset.

Details in [./Gradient_Boosting_Case_Study.ipynb](./Gradient_Boosting_Case_Study.ipynb).
